# Smart-Light-Switch
This project involves an ESP 8266-powered light switch, designed to control Philips Hue smart lights. A case for the switch was designed using Fusion 360 and 3D printed. The device, programmed with Arduino IDE, automatically connects to WiFi and toggles lights on or off with each click.
